# OOP Final Exam (Delivery System)

This project contains delivery system: `customer`, `driver`, and `order`. The system is designed to update customer whether the order is delivered or the order is correct.
  
---

## Features
`Customer` and `Driver` are inherited from `Person` class, which assign them their names. After that, `Customer` class will add address attribute, and `Driver` class will add vehicle attribute. The `DeliveryOrder` class is used by `Customer` class to place the order, assign the driver to the order, and summarize the order. Then, after delivery finished, driver will change the status from "preparing" to "delivered", which is a feature in `Driver` class.
