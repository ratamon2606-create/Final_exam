# OOP Final Exam (Delivery System)

This project contains delivery system: `customer`, `driver`, and `order`. The system is designed to update customer whether the order is delivered or the order is correct.

---

## Features
Customer and Driver are inherited from Person class, which tell name and vehicle(if that person is a driver). The DeliveryOrder class is used to order things, assign the driver to the order, and summarize the order. Then, driver will change the status from "preparing" to "delivered".

git clone https://github.com/ratamon2606-create/Final_exam.git

## Problem Encountered
I do not really understand the question and what it wants me to do, so I tried my best to copy the result. Also, my computer cannot screenshot (Window+Shift+S) more than 1 time, and sadly, I already did it this morning, so I apologize for the missing picture. However, I have checked that my code's result is pretty similar to the exam.
