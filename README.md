# OOP Final Exam (Delivery System)

This project contains delivery system: `customer`, `driver`, and `order`. The system is designed to update customer whether the order is delivered or the order is correct.

---

## Features
Customer and Driver are inherited from Person class, which tell name and vehicle(if that person is a driver). The DeliveryOrder class is used to order things, assign the driver to the order, and summarize the order. Then, driver will change the status from "preparing" to "delivered".
